# Lessons Learned

This project reinforced several important concepts:

- Wi-Fi security is strongly dependent on correct configuration.
- Weak passwords are still one of the biggest risks.
- Many attacks rely on user behavior and social engineering.
- Defensive measures like WPA3, strong passwords, and monitoring
  significantly reduce risk.
- Practical testing in a controlled lab environment is essential
  for understanding real-world threats.

These lessons improve my understanding of wireless security
from both attacker and defender perspectives.
