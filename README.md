# WiFi-Security-Analysis
Practical Wi-Fi security analysis and penetration testing techniques with attack scenarios and defensive measures.

This repository presents a practical Wi-Fi security analysis
from a penetration tester perspective.

The project focuses on understanding how wireless networks work,
how common Wi-Fi attacks are performed, and how to properly
secure wireless environments against these attacks.

This repository was created as a hands-on learning project
and for ethical penetration testing purposes only.

## Project Scope

- Understanding Wi-Fi security protocols (WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3)
- Analyzing wireless network behavior
- Simulating common Wi-Fi attacks in a lab environment
- Identifying weaknesses in wireless configurations
- Applying security best practices for Wi-Fi networks

## Tools Used

- Kali Linux
- Aircrack-ng
- Wireshark
- Wireless adapter supporting monitor mode

## Repository Structure

- lab-setup: Lab environment configuration
- attacks: Common Wi-Fi attack scenarios
- defenses: Wi-Fi security and mitigation techniques
- tools: Overview of tools used during analysis

## Disclaimer

All demonstrations and attack scenarios in this repository
were performed in a controlled lab environment.
This project is intended for educational purposes only.
