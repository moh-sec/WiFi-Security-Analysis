# Findings & Results

During the lab tests, the following observations were made:

- Capturing a WPA/WPA2 handshake is possible in a controlled environment,
  and it allows offline password testing.
- Weak passwords can be cracked if the handshake is captured.
- Evil Twin attacks can succeed if users connect without verifying the network.
- Disabling WPS and using strong passwords significantly reduce risks.
- Using WPA3 and monitoring connected devices improves overall security.

These results show that Wi-Fi security is often broken by weak configuration
and user behavior, not only by technical vulnerabilities.
